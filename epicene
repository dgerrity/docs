</blockquote>
<p>Of the 7,164 world languages cataloged by Ethnologue in 2022,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup> 454 are living languages descended from Proto-Indo-European (“PIE”)<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a></sup>. Although fractional in number, roughly half of all humans today speak a PIE descendant, with nearly one billion speaking a Romance Language and half a billion speaking a Germanic language, including Modern English (“English”).</p>
<p>The complexity of PIE and its contemporary derivative languages is significant. While PIE had neither definite nor indefinite articles (e.g., <em>the</em>, <em>a(n)</em>), its complexity was driven primarily by gender and case, creating an intricate system of inflections to convey grammatical relationships and meanings.</p>
<p>A word about <em>gender</em>, a powerful word used when describing languages. Corbett, a linguistic scholar who has extensively studied and written about gender, makes an important observation regarding the term: “Genders are classes of nouns reflected in the behavior of associated words…. The classification frequently corresponds to a real-world distinction of sex, at least in part…(‘gender’ derives etymologically from Latin <em>genus</em>, via Old French <em>gender</em>, and originally meant ‘kind’ or ‘sort’).”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">3</a></sup> The importance of the history of the word gender lies in its essence as a classification or organization tool for the human mind, presumably to aid in pattern matching.  The word <em>gender</em> has historically been used as a means of categorization and it is possible that only in more recent millennia has it come to be associated with biological sex. Another gender scholar, Don Killian, asserts, “Gender assignment is largely arbitrary, even for the highest segments of the animacy hierarchy, where one could expect to find assignment based on salient features of the referent (such as sex).”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">4</a></sup></p>
<p>Further related to gender is the term <em>epicene</em>, defined by the Oxford English Dictionary (“OED”) as “[Adj.] 1. Grammar. In Latin and ancient Greek grammar: designating a class of nouns which may denote either males or females but which have a fixed grammatical gender (masculine, feminine, neuter, etc.); of or relating to such nouns. Hence in modern English and other languages: designating nouns and pronouns which may denote individuals of either sex; of or relating to such nouns. Cf. common adj. A.IV.18a. c1450–”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">5</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Linguistics scholars use the word <em>epicene</em> to describe effectively a non-gendered word substituting for one that is gendered: Greville Corbett explains, “Epicene nouns are therefore those which denote sexed beings but which do not differentiate them according to sex…. The existence of two separate nouns or of just one is a matter of lexis and morphology [and not] gender.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6">6</a></sup>  Thus an epicene pronoun would be one used to refer to a noun without implying the “sex” or “gender” of the referent.</p>
<p>PIE relied on gender and inflected word forms (e.g., endings and stem changes) to indicate distinctions in case, number, gender, tense, mood, voice, and aspect. PIE had <strong>eight</strong> cases for inflection purposes: Nominative (subject), Accusative (direct object), Dative (indirect object), Genitive (possessive), Locative, Instrumental, and Vocative. PIE cases were applied to nouns using three genders (masculine, feminine, and neuter) and three numbers (singular, dual,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn7" id="fnref7">7</a></sup> plural<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn8" id="fnref8">8</a></sup>), yielding 72 possibilities for inflecting a noun such that it is in agreement with its context<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn9" id="fnref9">9</a></sup>.</p>
<p>As PIE moved into Proto-Germanic (“PG”), an ancestor of English, inflectional complexity was retained.  PG nouns were inflected across five cases, two numbers, and three genders, yielding 54 possibilities of inflection for a noun. See further this example in Hochdeutsch (Modern Standard German, or simply “German”),<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn10" id="fnref10">10</a></sup> which shows some of Modern German’s 24 possible inflectional combination of nouns.  Verbs in German are conjugated over two tenses, three moods, one voice, one aspect, three persons, and two numbers, yielding 36 syntactically indicated conjugations.</p>

</table><p>Few of the 454 living PIE descendants have as little gendering, inflection, and conjugational complexity as English<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn11" id="fnref11">11</a></sup>. Dressler and colleagues quoted by Marzi define a strict ordering in PIE derivatives running from Lithuanian → Greek → Russian → Croation → Spanish → German → Dutch → French → English, with English being the least complex[^marzi]. Moreover, the closest cousins to English are in the Germanic family (German, Dutch, Scandinavian, etc.), are all tri-gender (masculine, feminine, and neuter), and heavily inflected. Consider that English lacks gendered nouns, has only two patterns for regular verb conjugation, does not inflect definite and indefinite articles, requires no agreement for adjectives and prescribes only a few cases (common, genitive, and object), some actually disappearing. McWhorter, who writes extensively on the remarkable simplification of English over time<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn12" id="fnref12">12</a></sup>, claims English is among the simplest modern languages in the world in terms of inflectional complexity, and lack of gender is a patent outlier.  Truly, the only remaining formal markers of gender in English outside of sex-specific nouns like woman and man,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn13" id="fnref13">13</a></sup> are the third-person personal pronouns as follows:<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn14" id="fnref14">14</a></sup></p>

</table><p>Why, then, is there a pronounced movement<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn15" id="fnref15">15</a></sup> among English speakers to drive gender markers out of the practically gender-free language by defining an epicene third-person personal pronoun? Why delete, modify, or replace categorizing pronouns that have survived over at least seven millennia and trace back to the same PIE roots as hundreds of other languages? Are there similar movements afoot in other heavily gendered languages, such as our linguistic cousins from PIE/Germanic (e.g., Scandinavian Languages) and PIE/Italic (e.g., Romance Languages), experiencing similar movements?  What solutions, if any, are emerging in those related movements?</p>
<h2 id="the-case-for-gender-in-english">The Case for Gender in English</h2>
<p>It turns out that formidable reasons still exist to inspire movement toward a gender-free language in general a set of epicene personal pronouns in specific. Firstly, scholars such as Corbett make a compelling case that English is, in fact, a gendered language<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn16" id="fnref16">16</a></sup>.  To my surprise, yet making complete sense in retrospect, Natsuki, Atagi <em>et. al.</em> have studied how speakers of languages without formal noun and/or adjectival gendering effectively <u>impute their own genders</u>.  In other words, conceptualizing genders is possibly something anchored in the thinking of <em>homo sapiens</em> independent of language rather than as a result of well-understood syntactical or semantic rules imposed on thought by language encoding. It appears reasonable to hypothesize that categorization has, over tens of thousands of years, somehow proven useful for memory, communication, and organizational purposes in personkind.</p>
<p>As one might expect, speakers of gendered languages such as Spanish are more likely to categorize a feminine noun with stereotypically feminine conceptualizations,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn17" id="fnref17">17</a></sup> e.g., <em>la</em> in Spanish is associated with the nouns that label girl, queen, nun, and so forth.  What was surprising was how speakers of English have established clear gender associations with formally ungendered adjectives and labels (presumably for the aforementioned organizational benefits).  For example, in Natsuki’s controlled study, the three words <em>pretty</em>, <em>careful</em>, and <em>nice</em> were given feminine conceptualizations by English-speaking people independent of gender, whereas <em>careless</em>, <em>happy</em>, and <em>messy</em> were conceptualized as masculine.  Of critical import, Fortson reminds us in his seminal textbook <em>Indo-European Language and Culture</em><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn18" id="fnref18">18</a></sup> that every human learns language from scratch, matching sound patterns to meaning word-by-word instead of learning to understand rules of grammar or vocabulary. In this regard, languages with formal gender rules are not different than those without; infants make sense and categorize words according to what they hear and see.</p>
<p>Further to this line of thinking, English speakers have actually created new words to mark gender in some cases where existing words did not.  Consider the English word <em>actor</em>, entering Middle English in the late 14th century as “an overseer, guardian, steward” from Latin <em>actor</em>.  In the 1580s, its definition expanded to include "doer, “maker,” and attestations from those times are specifically noted by Etymonline<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn19" id="fnref19">19</a></sup> to have been epicene: applying to women, man, and animals without implying a gender.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn20" id="fnref20">20</a></sup> Since <em>actor</em> did not indicate gender specifically and some English speakers presumably specifically desired to differentiate, English borrowed the -ess suffix from the French -esse (in turn from Latin -issa, Greek -ισσά) or perhaps the whole French word <em>actrice</em> to create the English word <em>actress</em>. Looking at the usage trends in Google ngrams<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn21" id="fnref21">21</a></sup>, the word <em>actress</em> reveals something astonishing: the word’s usage was reasonably stable at around 2.0/mm until 1960, when it more than <strong>doubled</strong> its usage to the current of 4.5/mm at a time when the feminist movement was surging.  English speakers were, and are, increasingly categorizing the word <em>actor</em> as masculine and <em>actresses</em> as feminine.</p>
<p>Consider <em>hero</em>, per Etymonline, “man of superhuman strength or physical courage,” taken from French &lt; Greek (ἥρως héros) &lt; PIE *ser- ‘to protect.’ <em>Heroine</em> was not introduced into English until 1650, borrowing from Latin, and is defined as “Heroic woman, woman distinguished by exalted courage or noble achievements.”  Usage of the word <em>heroine</em> peaked in 1900 at 4/mm, decreased to a low in 1940 of approximately 1.75/mm, and has steadily increased again to its current level of 3.0/mm. From Etymonline, Comedienne, an actress who plays comedy, appeared in English in 1849, borrowed from French. Its usage peaked in 1990 at 0.07/mm and has recently tailed off. These examples show that English speakers sometimes reflect a mental conceptualization of a category of a noun or adjective in language when unnecessary or previously absent.  Corbett refers to these in his other works as "lexical oppositions instantiated through derivational morphology,” meaning gendered versions of epicene words are produced through normal orthographical processes.</p>
<p>This behavior is not limited to English. For example Corbett writes more recently that German nouns of neuter gender can be inflected by speakers using what he calls “semantic agreement,” meaning applying masculine or femine agreements to a neuter noun. This is because the rules of German classify diminutives as neuter regardless of the gender of the base. Typically, dimunutives are formed by adding an umlaut to the vowel and adding -chen, resulting in a word that is automatically neuter.  Mädchen, meaning young maiden, is syntactically <strong>das</strong> Mädchen (neuter), though speakers may use feminine endings and pronouns since the referent is assumed to be female. When using an adjective and an indefinite article to describe a person, speakers have applied feminine endings (-e) rather than the neuter endings (null, -es). The speakers are applying gendered thinking in spite of syntactical rules.</p>
<p>Nouns and adjectives, in general, are associated with categories in the human mind, whether language rules require such categorization or not, and those arbitrary categories have come to be associated with biological sex.</p>
<h2 id="pie-third-person-personal-pronouns">PIE Third-Person Personal Pronouns</h2>
<p>Moving beyond nouns into the more specific world of pronouns, the categorization concept shifts from “arbitrary” toward the dozen or so gender-specific nouns applying to familial relationships, like woman, niece, daughter, sister, and aunt.  Even more specifically, personal pronouns apply to persons (first, second, third) and have traditionally be gendered accordering to biological sex.</p>
<p>According to the American Heritage Dictionary of Indo-European Roots,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn22" id="fnref22">22</a></sup> the English pronoun <em>he</em> derives from the PIE root *h₁éyos- ‘he, that one.’  Etymonline, though, shows <em>he</em> as deriving from Proto-Germanic *hi-, itself a variant of the PIE root *ko- ‘this, here’.  Wiktionary quotes the PIE root of <em>he</em> as *ḱís- ‘this, here.’ Finally, OED ties the derivation back through Germanic languages, which in turn refer back to PIE for yet another interpretation.</p>
<p>To avoid confusion, the actual reconstructed pronouns themselves are detailed below rather than their reported ties to PIE roots. Considering phonological, orthographical, morphological, and syntactical changes, the third-person personal pronouns in many languages can be seen in the table below, sourced from Wikipedia.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn23" id="fnref23">23</a></sup></p>

</table><p>While it’s tempting to think of language as coming from “made-up” words, it has become obvious – at least to the author – that words are anything but made up.  Rather, they draw on thousands of years of history, tradition, and language-specific allomorphy.  It seems downright impossible to, for example, create a new personal pronoun simply from phonological and semantic preferences alone.  Each of the PIE descendant languages has its own path between PIE and its modern-day pronouns; little evidence appears to exist to support the notion that languages could invent their own.</p>

</table><h2 id="gender-neutral-pronouns-in-modern-english">Gender-Neutral Pronouns in Modern English</h2>
<p>First, in fairness to those who ask to be referenced by a pronoun other than the pronoun the syntactical rules of English would naturally select, it is important to note that most people using nearly any language feel an option, if not a right, to declare how they would like to be called, as their chosen name.  A name, while a proper noun and not a pronoun, is a label that serves an important role in language. My formal first name is Daniel, and I use <em>Dan</em> in English- and German-language contexts.  However, I generally use and request <em>Daniel</em> in Spanish- and Portuguese-language contexts because that name is more common and, more importantly, easier to pronounce.  Latin languages tend to have few words ending in a nasal or lingual stop, such as “n.”  Instead, they do have a relatively large number of words ending in the lateral approximate “l”.  In Portuguese, “l” is pronounced as a “w” and Daniel has the IPA transliteration of /dɐˈniɛw/.  In Spanish, the name Daniel yields the IPA transliteration of /daˈnjel/, where the alveolar nasal is immediately followed by the high front unrounded vowel, making it flow.  No one has ever thought it was odd that I would request to be referred to as Dan, Danny, or Daniel.</p>
<p>If a person has the natural liberty to request a specific proper noun as a referent, why, then, should a similar request regarding a pronoun be problematic?</p>
<p>The subtle difference is the use of nicknames or substitute proper nouns is frequently designed to improve the fluidity and ease of pronunciation of that proper noun.  Should that same objective be part of the determination of an alternate pronoun?</p>
<h3 id="they">They</h3>
<p>According to <a href="http://pronouns.org">pronouns.org</a>, the following sentence follows from the use of <em>they</em> as an epicene pronoun: “They are a writer and wrote that book themself. Those ideas are theirs. I like both them and their ideas.”</p>
<p>The use of <em>they</em> as an epicene (gender-neutral) pronoun in modern English<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn24" id="fnref24">24</a></sup> has a long and continuously evolving history (see Merriam-Webster<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn25" id="fnref25">25</a></sup> and the American Dialect Society<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn26" id="fnref26">26</a></sup>).  The use of the normally plural <em>they</em> to refer to a singular person has been attested since at least Middle English in the 14th Century<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn27" id="fnref27">27</a></sup>. For example, Geoffrey Chaucer used it in “The Canterbury Tales.”  <em>They</em> was employed to refer to an indefinite pronoun or a singular person whose gender was unknown or unspecified, though, importantly, it still retained its plural quality for agreement purposes.  In Early Modern English (16th - 17th Century), writers like William Shakespeare used “they” as a singular pronoun. In “The Comedy of Errors,” he wrote: “There’s not a man I meet but doth salute me / As if I were their well-acquainted friend.”  Later, during the 18th century, grammarians started promoting the use of <em>he</em> as a universal pronoun, which led to a decline in the use of the singular <em>they</em> in formal writing. (Studies<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn28" id="fnref28">28</a></sup> have shown that using <em>he</em> as a universal pronoun generally fails to satisfy any goals associated with epicene.) Nevertheless, the singular-referring plural-agreeing <em>they</em> persisted in colloquial usage and informal contexts.  In the 20th Century,  feminist movements highlighted the limitations of using <em>he</em> as a universal pronoun and advocated for more inclusive language. This renewed interest in using epicene <em>they</em> as a gender-neutral pronoun.</p>
<p>Recognizing that, though, omits the question of fluidity and pronounceability. The sentence “They are a writer and wrote that book themself. Those ideas are theirs. I like both them and their ideas" yields some awkwardness for English-speakers.  As a positive, the word “themself” would be more in agreement with the singular nature of they; however, the word is less familiar to native speakers and can be heard as awkward or even incorrect.  <em>They</em> as a plural referent coupled with the singular indefinite article “a” and singular “writer” can potentially cause an interruption in what would be an autonomic processing of the sentence below the conscious level.  In other words, the listener must break conscious processing mechanisms in the brain to fully understand the speaker.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the use of so-called singular <em>they</em> has gained significant acceptance and recognition. Major style guides, such as the Associated Press (AP) and the Chicago Manual of Style, have acknowledged the validity of using <em>they</em> as a singular pronoun. In 2015, the American Dialect Society named singular <em>they</em> its Word of the Year. In 2019, Merriam-Webster added the non-binary use of <em>they</em> to its dictionary and named it the Word of the Year.</p>
<p>What remains unclear, though, is agreement (singular/plural) in other cases, such as the object, possessive, and reflexive forms.</p>

</table><h3 id="neopronouns">Neopronouns</h3>
<p>Neopronouns are personal pronouns created to be used as alternatives to traditional pronouns. They are designed to provide gender-neutral options and respect the identities of people who do not identify as a binary gender or with their gender assigned at birth. These pronouns can be especially useful for non-binary, genderqueer, and other gender-nonconforming individuals.</p>
<p>There are many examples of neopronomical systems, using words such as ze, hir, xe, xem, ey, em, faer, faers, zher, and others.  Many such pronouns are driven by phonetic, syllabic, or rhythmic purposes, for example “Ze went to the store,” “I gave it to hir,” “It was zhers,” “I talked to xem yesterday,” “I met em at the event,” “This is faers book.” Each of those examples reflects a rhythmic and phonetic similarity to one or more of the existing pronouns, and rolls off the English-speaker’s tongue easily.</p>
<p>Among the more popular, or at least often discussed, are the so-called “ze” pronouns.  Purportedly influenced by the German “sie,” the feminine singular personal pronoun likely descending from a PIE root *h₁e- or *h₂e- (as previously mentioned, with morphology resulting in *sī in Proto-Germanic. Again, according to <a href="http://pronouns.org">pronouns.org</a>, there are two variants of ze pronouns, generally referred to as ze/hir and ze/zir.  For example, using ze/hir, one could say or write, “Ze is a writer and wrote that book hirself. Those ideas are hirs. I like both hir and hir ideas.” Similarly, using ze/zir pronouns, the following would be appropriate: "Ze is a writer and wrote that book zirself. Those ideas are zirs. I like both zir and zir ideas.”  There are also voiced versions of these pairs: zhe /ʒiː/ and zhir /ʒɪr/.</p>
<p>One concern about neopronouns is the lack of clarity around the forms to use in the few cases still required of personal pronouns: subject, object, possessive, and reflexive.  There is no natural affiliation with, for example, he, him, his, and himself. Such inflections must be clearly defined and then learned by rote memorization.  Given the contemporaneous deterioration of casing in pronouns, where current English speakers consistently mix object and subject case with personal pronouns (e.g., “her and I went to the store; me and him used to play basketball together”), it seems unlikely that native speakers could pick up new pronouns like this and learn increasingly ignored rules about inflecting according to case.</p>
<p>Finally, while English words certainly can be invented, and when invented, often do conform to rules of allomorphy, phonology, and orthography, it seems that such an enormously used word like <em>he</em> with a current ngram index of nearly 4000/mm would be irreplaceable if driven only by some at the grassroots level in the absence of some authoritative body governing the language.</p>
<p>The one <em>possible</em> wrinkle here in the case of “ze” is that an argument could potentially be made for a tie back to PIE roots.  Consider the third-person personal pronoun in a few PIE-derived languages below.  It does appear that <em>ze</em> could possibly be an allomorph of sorts for the feminine pronoun:</p>

<p>There has been considerable progress in the use of a “manufactured” epicene singular third-person personal pronoun in Scandinavian languages, including especially Swedish, which have a perhaps coincidental allomorphy among the masculine and feminine forms as shown in the following table.</p>

</table><p>In April of 2015, hen<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn29" id="fnref29">29</a></sup> was added to the official Swedish language dictionary Svenska Akademiens ordlista <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn30" id="fnref30">30</a></sup> of the Swedish Academy. Hen was purportedly inspired by the Finnish epicene third-person pronoun listed above. (Finnish is not derived from PIE and is therefore unrelated to the Scandinavian languages.) It is important to note that Swedes have used different natural morphologies of hen in different cases.  Hen was defined for nominative, and not necessarily other cases. For example, henom appears in written Swedish even though the intent was for hen to serve in the dative inflection.  Similarly, the possessive form was not necessarily defined, leaving Swedes to fall back on hens.</p>
<p>Thus, even <em>hen</em> suffers the awkwardness and ambiguity of neologisms.</p>

<p>Modern Latinate languages use specific endings to indicate gender for many parts of speech, and there has been a movement to neutralize gender by using an epicene “-e” in place of the “-o” or “-a” typically found in nouns.</p>

</table><p>One way to highlight this Latinate issue is to use an “@” to replace the ending gender-implying vowel, yielding, for example, latin@, amig@, or estudient@ (both a male and female student are estudiantes; however, using the article <em>el</em> or <em>la</em> changes the gender, so this notation is used to imply an unspecified sex).  Sentences then render as, for example, L@s niñ@s están jugando en el parque (the children are playing at the park).</p>
<p>Another growing yet controversial method is to replace the indicator “o” or “a” with an “e.”  For example, instead of “latino” or “latina,” write or say “<strong>latine</strong>” /latiː’neɪ/ to serve as an epicene noun.  This desire to eliminate the -o or -a is also likely the genesis of the English expression “Latinx” to mean Latino, Latina, Latine, or Latin@.  Criticisms of the use of word Latinx, based on personal conversations with members of the Latinate-speaking community, are that it follows none of the thousands of years of language traditions and cannot even be pronounced in the target languages. Its construction practically begs a white-male tech-inspired origin, where the letter x is supposed to be substituted by some other letter as in algebra or software. Importantly to native Spanish speakers, the letter “x” is not part of Modern Spanish , which has changed significantly since the Real Academia Española introduced orthographical simplifications in the 18th century. The letter is used only in geographical names or other words rooted in deep history.  In other words, “x” is deprecated in Spanish.  I have yet to find a native speaker of Spanish or Portuguese that has warmed to the term Latinx and, indeed, have found criticism that the expression LatinX is a device invented, and used, by non-native speakers uninformed of  the original role of gender as simply a noun classification device.</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>In conclusion, my two initial hypotheses are disproven.  The first, that English is already practically gender-free is simply not true.  Gendered nouns exist in English and are important in familial relationships, honorifics, personal pronouns, and even speaker-driven creations like actresses are created when necessary.  More importantly, humans categorize words naturally into genders whether the language prescribes it or not.  When gender is descoped to its original meaning of noun categorization, it seems that the kind of gender elimination pressured by activism is independent of whether a language is gendered or otherwise inflectionally complex.</p>
<p>Similarly, my hypothesis that an epicene pronoun or a neologism designed to defeat sex-linked associations could be phonetically or rhythmically similar to existing pronouns to become widespread and useful is incorrect. The universal properties of language: inflection, case, and agreement, still apply, and unless an epicene pronoun can be developed that is consistent with those propertiesa and then be memorized by millions, phonetic and rhythmic similarities alone are insufficient to achieve the goal.</p>
<p>Using <em>they</em> to refer to a single referent is accepted though does not need to be overly complex. My recommendation to those choosing <em>they</em> it to use the word as it is, including agreement and casing and break only the syntactical rule of number. “They wrote a book by themselves, and their book gave them fame.”  I do not recommend trying to create “themself” or “theys” or other attempts to fix the number problem in cases other than nominative because it introduces more trouble than benefit.</p>
<p>In the end, though, the aims of those seeking an epicene pronoun may not be fully aligned with the real changes sought.  In my personal opinion, the path to eliminating gender bias in language is not through altering pronouns, which would do nothing for categorization processes embedded in all speakers, instead, it relies on careful and thoughtful awareness of unconscious bias resulting in careful and thoughtful application of language <em>within</em> its bounds.  For example, referring to humans or persons, and avoiding stereotyped role association, using she when referring to unknown users, customers, clients, etc.  The problematic consequences of gender stereotyping are in the mind, not the language.</p>
<p>We must work to make our own internal bias more conscious and express ourselves in our own language to make lasting change.</p>
